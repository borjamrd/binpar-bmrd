# Poke API Project

![Image Alt text](/public/pokeapi.png "Pokeapi")

This project is a small web application developed using Typescript and Next.js. It displays real-time information from the Pok√© API. Below are the specific requirements of the project:

## Requirements

- [ ] List of all Pokemon: The main page of the project should display a list of all Pokemon, ordered by their id. For each Pokemon, it should show at least the name, generation, and types. Additional relevant information can also be displayed.

- [ ] Filters in the list: Two selectors should be added to filter the list by Type and Generation.

- [ ] Name search: Implement a real-time text search feature to filter the list by Pokemon names. The search should also include the Pokemon's evolutions. For example, searching for "Pikachu" should also display "Pichu" and "Raichu".

- [ ] Pokemon information page: Clicking on a Pokemon in the list should navigate to a page displaying detailed information about that Pokemon. This information should include:

  - [ ] Name
  - [ ] Image
  - [ ] Generation
  - [ ] Types
  - [ ] Evolutions (with images)
  - [ ] Stats

- [ ] Clicking on one of the evolutions should navigate to the page of that Pokemon. The current evolution should be visually marked to indicate that it is the current Pokemon.
